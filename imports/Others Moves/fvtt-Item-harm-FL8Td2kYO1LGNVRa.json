Injury severity depends on how much harm you have suffered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0-harm wounds have only minor, short term effects.</li>\n<li>4-7 harm wounds are serious and unstable. They will get worse unless treated. Mark the “Unstable” box.</li>\n<li>8-harm or more will kill a normal human, including a hunter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Armour reduces the harm suffered by the number of points it is rated for.</p>\n<p>Monsters may not be defeated until you use their weakness against them, and this applies to some minions as well.</p>",
